# To add an gif to a repository, you must have the link to the gif!
- To make an image a link you can put it in your repository and then use the link from the webaddress
- Like so <img src="https://github.com/New-UCCS/Tutorials-Important/blob/main/webaddress.PNG"/>

#### You can then do:
``` ![alt text](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/gifname.gif?raw=true)```

If you have the gif on your repo. 
#### Or, if your image is hosted externally, you can do this
```![alt text](http://url/to/gifname.gif)```

You can use the gif as long as you have the permissions to! Any violations will be removed at will of gif holder.
# When completed you'll have something that looks like this:
