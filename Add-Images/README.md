# To add an image to a repository, you must have the link to the image!
- To make an image a link you can put it in your repository and then use the link from the webaddress
- Like so <img src="https://github.com/New-UCCS/Tutorials-Important/blob/main/webaddress.PNG"/>

#### You can then do:
``` ![alt text](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)```
### Or
```<img src="WEB ADDRESS"/> ```

If you have the image on your repo. 
#### Or, if your image is hosted externally, you can do this
```![alt text](http://url/to/img.png)```
### Or
```<img src="WEB ADDRESS"/> ```

You can use the image as long as you have the permissions to! Any violations will be removed at will of photo holder.
# When completed you'll have something that looks like this:
